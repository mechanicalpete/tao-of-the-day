    "S": "If men are not afraid to die,\nIt is no avail to threaten them with death.\n\nIf men live in constant fear of dying,\nAnd if breaking the law means that a man will be killed,\nWho will dare to break the law?\n\nThere is always an official executioner.\nIf you try to take his place,\nIt is like trying to be a master carpenter and cutting wood.\nIf you try to cut wood like a master carpenter, you will only hurt your hand."
