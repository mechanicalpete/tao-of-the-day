    "S": "In caring for others and serving heaven,\nThere is nothing like using restraint.\nRestraint begins with giving up one's own ideas.\nThis depends on Virtue gathered in the past.\nIf there is a good store of Virtue, then nothing is impossible.\nIf nothing is impossible, then there are no limits.\nIf a man knows no limits, then he is fit to be a ruler.\nThe mother principle of ruling holds good for a long time.\nThis is called having deep roots and a firm foundation,\nThe Tao of long life and eternal vision."
