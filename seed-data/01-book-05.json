    "S": "Heaven and Earth are impartial;\nThey see the ten thousand things as straw dogs.\nThe wise are impartial;\nThey see the people as straw dogs.\n\nThe space between heaven and Earth is like a bellows.\nThe shape changes but not the form;\nThe more it moves, the more it yields.\nMore words count less.\nHold fast to the center."
