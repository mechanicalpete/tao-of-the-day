    "S": "The great Tao flows everywhere, both to the left and to the right.\nThe ten thousand things depend upon it; it holds nothing back.\nIt fulfills its purpose silently and makes no claim.\n\nIt nourishes the ten thousand things,\nAnd yet is not their lord.\nIt has no aim; it is very small.\n\nThe ten thousand things return to it,\nYet it is not their lord.\nIt is very great.\n\nIt does not show greatness,\nAnd is therefore truly great."
