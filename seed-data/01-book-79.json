    "S": "After a bitter quarrel, some resentment must remain.\nWhat can one do about it?\nTherefore the sage keeps his half of the bargain\nBut does not exact his due.\nA man of Virtue performs his part,\nBut a man without Virtue requires others to fulfill their obligations.\nThe Tao of heaven is impartial.\nIt stays with good men all the time."
