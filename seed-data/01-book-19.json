    "S": "Give up sainthood, renounce wisdom,\nAnd it will be a hundred times better for everyone.\n\nGive up kindness, renounce morality,\nAnd men will rediscover filial piety and love.\n\nGive up ingenuity, renounce profit,\nAnd bandits and thieves will disappear.\n\nThese three are outward forms alone; they are not sufficient in themselves.\nIt is more important\nTo see the simplicity,\nTo realize one's true nature,\nTo cast off selfishness\nAnd temper desire."
