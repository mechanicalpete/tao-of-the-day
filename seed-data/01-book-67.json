    "S": "Everyone under heaven says that my Tao is great and beyond compare.\nBecause it is great, it seems different.\nIf it were not different, it would have vanished long ago.\n\nI have three treasures which I hold and keep.\nThe first is mercy; the second is economy;\nThe third is daring not to be ahead of others.\nFrom mercy comes courage; from economy comes generosity;\nFrom humility comes leadership.\n\nNowadays men shun mercy, but try to be brave;\nThey abandon economy, but try to be generous;\nThey do not believe in humility, but always try to be first.\nThis is certain death.\n\nMercy brings victory in battle and strength in defense.\nIt is the means by which heaven saves and guards."
